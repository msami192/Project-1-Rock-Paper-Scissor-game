# This is my First Ever coding project with Python and also the first time I have pushed my code to Github.

This is a very basic Rock, Paper, Scissor Game that is played in the VS code terminal.

It contains two files;
main.py contains two types of coding examples.
shortened.py contains the shorter coding example of the two for coding efficiency.

Thanks
